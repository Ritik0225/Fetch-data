# Fetch-data
The Fetch-data is a simple react application in which i have shown how we can get data dynamically from an API. The concepts used for performing this task are fetch API, useState hook, useEffect hook, and async&amp;await. In order to display the fetched data i made use of Bootstrap to show the content in a table format.
